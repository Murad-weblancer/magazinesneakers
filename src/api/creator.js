      "The sneaker community on Instagram is huge, so it can pretty tough to keep track of who to follow. Of course, there are many bloggers that most of us are familiar with, but sometimes it's more interesting to follow smaller accounts by passionate people from the Instagram sneaker community. So, are you bored of what you see, when you open the app? Need some inspiration? Here's a little round-up of some accounts worth checking out, both small and huge.",

But with its distinct identity, Jägermeister is way more than just another type of booze. That's why the Jägermeister #firstdrop collection translates this unmistakable appeal to 6 cutting-edge streetwear pieces. And to not only release a selection of fresh garments but also get the community itself involved, Jägermeister teamed up with several faces that are well-known in German streetwear circles.",

It's all about functional jackets designed for the city and it starts with the adidas MYSHELTER Rain Jacket. The MYSHELTER Rain Jacket has loads of tech features designed to keep you dry (and stylish) such as fully sealed seams, a high collar connected to an adjustable hood, a breathable membrane and really nice carry-on straps. It is made for everyday life, empowering young urban creators to leave the indoors behind and explore their city in any weather.",

For some people these words are the start of a long discussion about creativity, realness and fake online worlds; for others, these words do mean a lot and represent their creative hustle. Being creative on Instagram was never as popular and never as difficult at the same time than today. How can you stand out among a million other people? How can you stay true to yourself and not become a plaything of brands and an easy target for people that love to hate on people that love to share? To be an artist in these online worlds takes a lot. It drains your energy and makes you question yourself while it throws you out like a piece of raw meat into the masses of likes, shares and comments. Johnny Terror's world is part of this online mess, but his art and his work have found a balance to navigate between his own visual language, the taste of his audience and the likes of big brands and characters such as NikeLab, ACRONYM® and Errolson Hugh.",
